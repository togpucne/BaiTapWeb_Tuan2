                                    Welcome to the Sunny Acres Corn Maze. We first heard about mazes from agricultural
                                    exchange students who came from England in 1985. In Europe, mazes are very popular
                                    in castle gardens. After hearing about the mazes in Europe, we thought it would be a
                                    great idea to build one of our own right outside of Council Bluffs
                                    <br> <br>
                                    Since 1997, thousands of people have enjoyed our Com Mazes. We hope that your family
                                    gets as much enjoyment out of this year's Com Maze as we did building it! Our family
                                    would like to invite your family to come out and visit us at this year's Corn Maze
                                    and Autumn Fest
                                    <br> <br>
                                    Our new 15-acre maze (with over 4 miles of trails to explore) is filled with twist
                                    and turns that's good fun for adults and kids alike! See how adventurous you are as
                                    you wind through the maze while taking an interactive quiz. Answer the questions
                                    correctly and receive additional clues to solve the maze. For families with young
                                    children, our maze is filled with jokes, riddles and quests. Try to be the first in
                                    your group to punch out your quest card by visiting the secret spots. This maze is
                                    the perfect size and height for little ones, Resting places and educational displays
                                    are scattered throughout.
